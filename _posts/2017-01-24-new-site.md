So here's for this very new blog of mine - another one for me to try and struggle to keep! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

After having a couple os issues regarding my the previous space-filler version of this blog, and it's utter refuse to give up to this version, now this site is online and working! Cheers for me! :tada:

Here, I'll post any updates regarding my repositories, and also repost entries from my medicine blog, 'cause why not, right?

I'll try, in time, to set Disqus to work, but that's another time's migraine.

Thanks for sticking by! :kissing_smiling_eyes:
