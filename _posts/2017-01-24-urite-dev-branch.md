Since I've started coding [urite](https://github.com/Nereare/urite), I've being doing it mostly locally. It's not that big a project and, also, **I** am not that expert a programmer, so I chose to have the first wave of struggles by my self and post some code once at least the app's interface was done.

Then I came to an idea, seeing some opensourced ~serious~ apps: why not maintaining both the `master` branch, where more solid code resides, and solider code **only**, and create a new branch, a *development* branch, where I can push everytime, push every little alteration I wish to, push until git begs for mercy?

Hence, it's born [urite's `dev` branch](https://github.com/Nereare/urite/tree/dev), a place where many things may lie, but very little of them will work properly.
