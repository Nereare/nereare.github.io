It’s not that big a project and, also, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; am not that expert a programmer, so I chose to have the first wave of struggles by my self and post some code once at least the app’s interface was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came to an idea, seeing some opensourced ~serious~ apps: why not maintaining both the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, where more solid code resides, and solider code &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;, and create a new branch, a &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; branch, where I can push everytime, push every little alteration I wish to, push until git begs for mercy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it’s born &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nereare/urite/tree/dev&quot;&gt;urite’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/a&gt;, a place where many things may lie, but very little of them will work properly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Since I’ve started coding urite, I’ve being doing it mostly locally.
