This is a try at creating a central hub for my major internet activity. In other words, this site will very seldomly feature original content of its own, rather it will concatenate a myriad of links to posts on [my blog](https://nereare.wordpress.com/), social media and, of course, [GitHub](https://github.com/Nereare) announcements and releases.
